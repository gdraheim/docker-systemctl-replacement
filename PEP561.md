# PEP561

The PEP561 defines how to ensure that `*.pyi` files get included for
packaging. It does recommend to create a "py.typed" file in the module 
directory. However that does NOT apply for "module-only packages", that 
is a single python file without a directory (in src/).

Instead the pyi file has to be moved to a kind of typeshed whereas "mypy"
recognizes a stubs-module in the sys.path. So when we have `"systemctl.py"` 
then the typhints are put into `"systemctl-stubs/__init__.py"`.

However local tests continue to use `"tmp/systemctl.pyi"`. Atleast for
setuptools there is no way to get that file distributed in the same
place as `"systemctl.py"`.

# Recommendation

After some serious testing it seems that the stubs/-dir generation,
even that it is possible with `strip_python3.py`, is just too
cumbersome if the py-sources are originally typed.

Instead the "module-only" files should be moved into a versioned
subdirectory, and the "py.typed" file be created.

So... instead of "src" there is a "systemctl3" subdirectory.
Adding to "pyproject.toml":

        [tool.setuptools]
        script-files = ["systemctl3/systemctl.py"]
        package-dir = {"systemctl3" = "systemctl3"}
