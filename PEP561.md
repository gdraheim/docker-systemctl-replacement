# PEP561

The PEP561 defines how to ensure that `*.pyi` files get included for
packaging. It does recommend to create a "py.typed" file in the module 
directory. However that does NOT apply for "module-only packages", that 
is a single python file without a directory (in src/).

Instead the pyi file has to be moved to a kind of typeshed whereas "mypy"
recognizes a stubs-module in the sys.path. So when we have `"systemctl.py"` 
then the typhints are put into `"systemctl-stubs/__init__.py"`.

However local tests continue to use `"tmp/systemctl.pyi"`. Atleast for
setuptools there is no way to get that file distributed in the same
place as `"systemctl.py"`.
